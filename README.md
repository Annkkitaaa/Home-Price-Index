# Home-Price-Index



## Project Overview

This project aims to model and predict the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index based on various housing, construction, economic, and industry-specific datasets. The goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing home prices and create an accurate predictive model.

## Data Sources

The following key datasets have been identified and should be prioritized for analysis:

### Housing and Construction Data

- `houses_for_sale_to_houses_sold.csv`
- `new_privately_owned_housing_under_construction.csv`
- `privately_owned_housing_units_completed.csv`
- `residentialsa-ValueOfConstruction.csv` (and the `.xls` version)
- `nonresidentialsa-valueOfConstriction-Monthly.csv` (and the `.xls` version)
- `non_residential_private_construction_spending.csv`

### Economic Indicators

- `GDP.csv`
- `consumer_price_index.csv`
- `MORTGAGE30US.csv`
- `Unemployment rate.csv`
- `unemployment_rate_construction.csv`
- `job gains private.csv`

### Housing Market Indicators

- `homeownershiprate.csv`
- `renter_occupied_housing_rate.csv`
- `Permits_Granted_Monthly.csv`
- `target.csv` (assuming this is a key indicator or target variable for the analysis)

### Construction Industry Specifics

- `construction_workers_wages_index.csv`
- `employees_construction.csv`
- `Industrial_production_cement.csv`
- `producer_price_index_concrete_brick.csv`

### Housing Credit Availability Indices

- `HCAI_GOVT.csv` (and the `.xls` version)
- `HCAI_GSE.csv` (and the `.xls` version)
- `HCAI_PP.csv` (and the `.xls` version)

## Data Understanding

The first step in this project is to thoroughly understand the datasets and their contents. Each dataset should be explored, cleaned, and preprocessed as necessary. This may involve handling missing values, identifying and addressing outliers, and transforming variables if required.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

After data preparation, extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) should be conducted to gain insights into the relationships between the various features and the target variable (S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index). This analysis may involve visualizations, statistical tests, and correlation analyses to identify the most relevant features and potential multicollinearity issues.

## Feature Engineering

Based on the findings from the EDA, additional relevant features may need to be engineered or derived from the existing datasets. This could include creating lagged variables, calculating ratios, or combining multiple features to capture more complex relationships.

## Model Selection and Evaluation

Once the feature set is finalized, various machine learning models should be trained and evaluated. This may include linear regression models, decision tree-based models, ensemble methods, and neural networks, among others. Appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared, should be used to assess model performance.

## Model Tuning and Optimization

The best-performing models should be further tuned and optimized to improve their predictive accuracy. This may involve techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, regularization, or feature selection methods.

## Model Deployment and Monitoring

After selecting the final model, it should be deployed and integrated into a production environment for continuous monitoring and updates. Appropriate strategies should be implemented to handle concept drift and model retraining as new data becomes available.

This heatmap shows the correlation between various economic indicators and a target variable (likely representing housing starts or construction activity). The color intensity represents the strength of correlation, with darker red indicating a strong positive correlation and darker blue indicating a strong negative correlation. The features with the strongest positive correlations appear to be CPI (Consumer Price Index), employees in the construction sector, GDP, and several housing-related indicators like HCAI_GOVT (Housing Cost Associated Index for Government), HCAI_GSE (Government-Sponsored Enterprises), and HCAI_PP (Private Pay). Indicators like unrate (unemployment rate) and nonresidential construction value show negative correlations with the target variable.

This bar chart displays the feature importance scores obtained from a Lasso Model, which is a type of regularized regression model. The length of the bars represents the relative importance of each feature in predicting the target variable. According to the chart, the most important features are GDP, construction activity, HCAI_GSE, and some housing-related indicators like residential construction value and home-ownership rate. Features like CPI, retail sales of home furnishing stores, and HCAI_PP have lower importance scores.

This line plot compares the predicted values (blue line) and observed values (red line) for a time series spanning from 2016 to 2020 (60 months). The y-axis represents the prediction or observed value, while the x-axis shows the months. The plot suggests that the predictive model was able to capture the overall trend and patterns in the data reasonably well, as the predicted and observed lines follow a similar trajectory. However, there are some discrepancies between the two lines, indicating that the model did not perfectly match the observed values at all time points.
